# High-Availability-Web-application-AWS
This is a project where I created a high availability web app in AWS

You need to build the Udagram Network stack first to have the Udagram Server stack work.

The command line used to create the stacks should look like below:

Network stack:
`create.sh UdagramServers Udagram-Network.yml Udagram-Network-Paramaters.json

Server stack:
`create.sh UdagramServers Udagram-Servers.yml Udagram-Servers-Paramaters.json
